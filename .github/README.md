# 🌊 Endless Escapade

Endless Escapade is an ambitious content mod for tModLoader, which heavily focuses around the usage of subworlds and greatly encompasses exploration and new adventures, while also enhancing previously
existing features and overall improving general quality of gameplay.

## ⚠️ How to play

The mod is currently not officially released, and we greatly discourage you to build it yourself. The development builds are replenished of unfinished work and potentially game breaking bugs, so we advise waiting. Doing so will grant you far better enjoyability and stability while playing the mod.
